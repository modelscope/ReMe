# Context compaction with decision models

`compact_context` proposes recoverable previews of old tool results. It scores evidence for the current task,
keeps tool calls and uncertain evidence, and leaves source history under the host's control. The provider-independent
`as_decision_model` interface currently supports AgentScope's TypeSafe/Jev adapter.

![Evidence, conservative selection, budget fitting, and source recovery](../figure/decision-context-compaction.svg)

## How it works

1. **Archive first.** Supply an AgentScope 2.x JSON message snapshot, `goal`, optional `next_action`, a read-only tool
   allowlist, and `source_refs` mapping original call IDs to recoverable archive locations. References are opaque host
   identifiers: ReMe does not open, verify, or create them. The host must archive before applying a proposal and provide
   a retrieval tool that resolves them. No reference means no compaction for that pair.
2. **Protect structure and indispensable evidence.** Pair unique `tool_call` / `tool_result` IDs. First, system, recent,
   explicitly protected messages and calls stay intact. Failed/unfinished calls, non-text results, invalid inputs,
   mismatched tool names, and ambiguous pairs stay intact. `eligible_tool_names` defaults to empty.
3. **Show bounded evidence.** Each request contains its own candidate units: tool name, input, result head/tail preview,
   character count and completeness flags. It also carries the goal, next action and bounded first/system/protected/recent text. Thinking is
   not sent. Hosts must sanitize inputs and outputs before inference; previews may contain source data.
4. **Ask one question per pair.** Does this evidence contain information needed to continue correctly? The question
   measures usefulness, not irrecoverability. Missing or truncated context expresses uncertainty. Oversized units are
   left unobserved and retained; they are never scored after their evidence has been removed.
5. **Replace only clearly unnecessary results.** At probability `<= drop_threshold` (default `0.1`), a result can become
   a verbatim head/tail excerpt plus its source reference. Higher, invalid, or missing probabilities retain the result.
   Provider errors and timeouts retain the affected evidence; external cancellation propagates after requests drain.

No tool call or message is deleted. Replacements occur only when shorter. User/assistant text, thinking, metadata and
source inputs remain unchanged. Explicitly protect constraints, audit receipts and unique evidence; probabilities are
not substitutes for host protection rules. The threshold is a conservative starting point, not a calibrated guarantee.

## Configure and call

```bash
pip install "reme-ai[core,decision]"
export DECISION_MODEL_API_KEY=your-typesafe-api-key
export DECISION_MODEL_BACKEND=agentscope
# Optional: DECISION_MODEL_NAME and DECISION_MODEL_BASE_URL
```

The CLI also loads `DECISION_MODEL_*` from `.env`. See [configuration](./configuration.md#decision-model-configuration).
An omitted or `null` model uses the SDK default.

Start the service in one terminal:

```bash
reme start config=decision_compaction
```

Call from another terminal, using references the host has already archived and can resolve:

```bash
reme compact_context \
  goal='Fix payment retries' next_action='Review the retry implementation' \
  eligible_tool_names='["search_code"]' source_refs='{"c1":"archive/demo/c1"}' \
  options='{"preserve_recent_messages":1}' \
  messages='[{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":"Fix retries"}]},{"role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"tool_call","id":"c1","name":"search_code","input":"{\"path\":\"icons\"}","state":"finished"},{"type":"tool_result","id":"c1","name":"search_code","output":"Old icon search results","state":"success"}]},{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":"Inspect payment code next"}]}]'
```

A short result may remain unchanged when adding the recovery marker would make it larger.
The preset inherits the default service and background jobs. For embedding, assemble only the compaction job/component
as shown in [integration tests](https://github.com/agentscope-ai/ReMe/blob/main/tests/integration/test_decision_compaction.py).

## Host token budget

Decision request estimates and downstream input budgets are separate. To enforce `max_output_tokens`, embed the Step
with a synchronous `token_counter(messages)` that counts the host's actual serialized model input, including system
instructions, tool schemas and framing. The counter must return a non-negative integer; configuration without a counter
fails before inference. ReMe's search tokenizers are not model token counters.

```python
step = CompactContextStep(as_decision_model=decision_model, token_counter=count_model_input)
response = await step(
    messages=snapshot,
    goal="Fix retries",
    next_action="Review the patch",
    source_refs=archive_refs,
    eligible_tool_names=["read_file"],
    options={"max_output_tokens": 32000},
)
```

Already within budget means no model requests. Otherwise eligible low-probability results are previewed in increasing
probability order until the budget is met. A replacement must reduce both size and the host count. Required/uncertain
content is never removed to force a fit. If it still does not fit, `reason="budget_exceeded"` and `budget_met=false`:
use host summarization or another fallback before applying. Without a requested budget, all eligible low-probability
results may be previewed and `budget_met` is `null`; the host must check the final input itself.

## Contract and defaults

The standard Response `answer` has `schema_version=2`, proposed `messages`, `changed`, `reason`, `budget_met`, `decisions`
and `stats`. Each decision has the original `call_id`, internal `id`, `action` (`keep` / `preview`), `probability`, `reason`
and `source_ref`. Reasons distinguish protection, uncertainty, unobserved evidence, invalid answers, provider errors,
timeout and no savings. Statistics include before/after sizes and host token counts, candidate/protection counts,
maximum estimated batch-state tokens, request count, usage and elapsed time. Statistics also appear in response metadata.

| Option | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `drop_threshold` | `0.1` | Preview only results at or below this probability |
| `preserve_recent_messages` | `6` | Protect this many recent messages |
| `evidence_chars` | `2000` | Maximum characters per input/result preview or recent text |
| `preview_chars` | `300` | Maximum head/tail excerpt in the proposed result, excluding recovery marker |
| `max_state_tokens` | `25000` | Estimated decision-state ceiling |
| `max_request_tokens` | `30000` | Estimated state/questions ceiling, including 256 tokens of overhead |
| `max_output_tokens` | `null` | Optional host-counted input budget |
| `max_concurrency` | `4` | Maximum concurrent decision requests |
| `total_timeout_seconds` | `30` | Overall request and queueing deadline |

The integration suite contains two synthetic scenarios: payment retry debugging and replica-lag investigation, with
important source/log evidence competing against completed unrelated tasks. Run explicitly with configured credentials:

```bash
REME_RUN_DECISION_INTEGRATION=1 pytest tests/integration/test_decision_compaction.py -v -s
```

Only model requests run externally; fixture tool calls are not executed. These cases test behavior, not general task
success. Evaluate real trajectories against recency and rule-based previews, measuring recovery, continuation quality,
latency and total cost alongside token reduction. ReMe does not automatically summarize or write persistent memory.

## Compaction strategy comparison

The [benchmark protocol and results](https://github.com/jinliyl/ReMe/blob/a013411457667ee062902252d43910bf8c87dc17/benchmark/compaction/RESULTS.md) use **30 distinct HotpotQA validation questions** with human gold answers
and sentence-level supporting facts: 15 bridge and 15 comparison questions, with no article shared between questions.
Hermes actually reads ten articles per question, producing 30 complete trajectories and 300 tool calls. Gold answers
and support labels stay outside the tool workspace and are used only for deterministic scoring. The final assistant
answer is excluded from the history to be compressed.

All compressed methods share a **3,600-token complete input ceiling**, including original system/task, evidence,
evaluation question and framing. Full context keeps public API message fields as an explicitly over-budget reference;
Hermes DB snapshots and internal reasoning fields never enter model inputs. Fusion retains Jev-selected original
evidence within 40% of available space, then summarizes remaining evidence using all unused capacity.

| Method | Input tokens | Reduction | Answer EM |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Full context | 5,482 | 0.0% | 61.7% |
| Jev | 2,606 | 52.5% | 51.7% |
| Summary | 2,686 | 51.0% | 61.7% |
| Jev + Summary | 3,043 | 44.5% | 60.0% |

Every method has 60/60 valid contexts and 120 answers. Actual compressed inputs use 2,392–3,447 tokens, all below
the ceiling. Fusion reduces downstream input by 44.5% and trails Full context by 1.7 percentage points in answer EM.
However, Summary also reaches 61.7% with less input; **superiority over both compressed baselines is not established**.
Supporting-fact F1 is 83.0% / 67.2% / 75.5% / 80.0% for Full / Jev / Summary / Fusion. These point estimates do not
establish statistical equivalence, and downstream reduction excludes compression overhead.

The primary metric is official answer Exact Match. Answer F1, supporting-fact and joint metrics are reported separately;
the primary metric does not change after observing results. Two compression generations and two answers per condition
produce 240 contexts and 480 answers. Budget overruns and generation failures score zero. Evaluation calls Qwen directly;
Hermes does not continue its agent loop and discarded evidence cannot be retrieved. Fusion remains experimental and
does not change the production `compact_context` contract above.
